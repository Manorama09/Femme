# Femme-Hack Girl Summer

What's your idea? This will be a short tagline for the project:-

With increasing crimes against women these days, we decided to build an application that keeps her safe. We made a cab safety application to make travel safe for women. It’ll give her the confidence while she travels alone.

## Inspiration:
The increasing crimes against women was the major inspiration for the project. The amount of crimes are increasing these days. Thus we resolved to build this project.

## What it does:

### Find your cab companion
As a passenger, Femme allows you to choose your own cab companion to ensure comfort during travel.

### Creating your journey by fixing the path
Femme allows its users to create new journeys and fix their path of travel to ensure safety.

### Get in touch with your cab companion
Once a journey is fixed, you can communicate with your cab companion using SMS services.

### Send alerts
In case a passenger senses any danger ahead, she can click on the alert button to intimate her emergency contacts for the same.

### Track your location
During travel, the location of the cab is tracked. In case of a deviation more than 1 km from the fixed path, an alert is sent to the passenger’s emergency contacts.

### Seamless user experience
The application uses minimalist UI and provides for great user experience to all our customers.


## How we built it: 

Using Google Map, Firebase and Android, the main application was created. 
The Website for the same was made using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. 
The whole design for the website and application was designed using Figma.

## Challenges we ran into :- 

The major challenge that we ran into was while integrating the apis. We took help of a lot of available online resources to understand. The major challenge was to make the path deviation detection system. Storing the coordinates nicely was a great challenge.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 

We managed to implement the path detection and deviation systems by fixing the routes. The passenger can track her journey when it starts and easily send alerts when deviation from the original path is detected.

## What we learned

Building the app was a great experience. We learned a lot of new stuff while making the project. Integrating google maps was something that we learned while making the project. The app has multiple screens and the logic is complex. Thus making the app from scratch was a completely new experience for us.  

## What's next for Femme 

We have planned features like detecting the nearby police station and directing a safe and short route towards it so that whenever the passenger is in danger she can reach easily and ask for help. 

We may also try to improve the UI if needed and make it more enhanced with newly added features.

We also wish to launch the app on playstore in the future and make it a real-life in use application.
