# FEMME - HER SAFETY, OUR CONCERN
## A submission for MLH-Hack Girl Summer

#### High crime-rate against women motivated us to build an app that ensures her safety at travel ; from deciding her cab-mate and journey, she can track her location and alert her contacts when in danger.   

### Youtube link to the demo: [Application Demo](https://youtu.be/7cx0F3dOkUU)

### Website link

The website is hosted on netlify and is live at https://femme.netlify.app .

### APK Download

The APK can be downloaded from the link: [FEMME APK DOWNLOAD](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WVjOJDfmBVjnYa_Ad8nKL-NsC34zmoeX/view?usp=sharing)

### Design

The interface was designed using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/3Z2pPD4J2dLM3xUZPXfRh5/FEMME?node-id=0%3A1)

## How we built it: 

*Android Application:*
Front-end software: XML;
Back-end software: Java;
Database: Firebase;
Text Editor: Android Studio

*Web Application:*
Front-end software: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap;
Text Editor: VS CODE

*Design:*
Figma;
Adobe Illustrator

## What it does:

*1. Finding a cab companion:*
Suppose a woman is to travel late at night, she can choose to travel with someone who is traveling the same path instead of traveling alone. On filling up the pickup point and the destination point, the app would show her the results listing all the women traveling the same path. She can choose who to travel with, as per her liking, and book her ride.
 
*2. Chatting with the cab companion:* 
After choosing your cab companion and confirming the ride, the woman can converse with her companion through text messages. 

*3. Alert on path deviation:*
Once the ride is confirmed, the app already decides a predefined route that the cab is supposed to follow. If there is any deviation noticed in the path being traversed, the user’s emergency contacts are immediately notified. These features and functionalities of the proposed application solve the problem of unsafe travel. 
The woman can travel with a companion and also keep her family updated in case of any upcoming danger. 

*4. Alert through the press of a single button:* 
If the user clicks on the alert button, then the emergency contacts of the user will be notified. We can also implement this functionality by pressing a single button in the application.

*5. Seamless User Experience:*
We ensure a smooth user experience by creating a minimalist UI.

## What's next for Femme: 

The application was built successfully and after conducting a survey within our community, we received a lot of positive remarks about the usefulness of the application and the idea of it. However, we also received feedback on the improvements to be done to help us provide a better user experience to our customers.

In future scope, we could add a feature of voice and video recording at the moment of danger and send it to the emergency contacts so that they are well informed about the situation and the action to be taken. We could also notify the nearest police station of the happening in order to bring her out of danger as soon as possible. 
We would also like to add a gesture recognition system to send alerts so that with a hand movement, alert messages can be sent to all the emergency contacts.

Another improvement is the addition of a functionality to take the driver’s and car’s picture and send it to her contacts before beginning the journey. 

Most importantly we aim to publish our application on playstore to increase our audience. Implementing these features would make it a perfect platform that a woman could carry along with her, while traveling with confidence.
